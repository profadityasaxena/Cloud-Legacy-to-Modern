Title: Modernizing Monolithic Applications with Language Models  
Authors: Rachana Talasila, Jason Anderson, Ke Xu  
arXiv:2309.03796v1 (2023)

Summary:
This paper explores a novel approach for modernizing monolithic software applications using large language models (LLMs), particularly generative models like GPT. Traditional modernization approaches often involve manually rewriting or redesigning legacy systems into microservices, which is labor-intensive, costly, and error-prone. The authors propose leveraging LLMs to automate parts of this process, significantly reducing developer effort and minimizing the risk of regressions.

Key contributions include:
1. **Proposed Framework**: The authors introduce a modular pipeline that uses LLMs to assist in code segmentation, transformation, and documentation, facilitating the migration of monolithic systems into microservice-ready components.
2. **Empirical Evaluation**: Using real-world legacy codebases, the authors evaluate the quality of LLM-generated code transformations, focusing on syntactic correctness, functional similarity, and developer usability.
3. **Tooling**: They developed a prototype toolchain integrating GPT-based language models into the modernization workflow. The tool suggests refactorings and decomposes classes and functions based on learned software design principles.
4. **Prompt Engineering**: The study emphasizes the importance of prompt design. They detail several prompt templates used to instruct LLMs to identify boundaries for service decomposition and recommend architectural refactors.
5. **Limitations**: Despite encouraging results, the authors acknowledge LLMs may hallucinate, lack contextual understanding over long codebases, and require careful human oversight. They suggest future work should include hybrid systems that combine symbolic reasoning with LLMs for more robust outcomes.

Overall, the paper contributes to the emerging field of AI-assisted software engineering by demonstrating how LLMs can play a critical role in legacy system modernization. It bridges software architecture and generative AI, proposing a pathway toward semi-automated cloud-native refactoring.

Significant Points for:

1. Purpose and Relevance:
- The paper evaluates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in modernizing legacy systems through automated code completion and migration support.
- It specifically targets enterprise-level monolithic codebases where manual refactoring is time-consuming and error-prone.

2. Key Contributions:
- Defined a taxonomy of LLM-assisted migration tasks: including interface modernization, API adaptation, dependency upgrades, and class refactoring.
- Introduced a benchmark dataset for migration support that includes legacy code snippets with expected modernized completions.
- Proposed metrics for evaluating LLM migration capabilities: syntactic validity, semantic correctness, and developer effort reduction.

3. Evaluation:
- Benchmarked several LLMs: Codex, CodeT5+, StarCoder on migration-related tasks using a curated dataset.
- Findings indicated that StarCoder and CodeT5+ demonstrated the highest syntactic completion accuracy (>80%) in Java and Python-based migrations.
- Codex was more prone to hallucinations in adapting deprecated constructs unless guided with precise prompts.

4. LLM Strengths and Limitations:
- LLMs are strong in identifying and completing repetitive migration patterns (e.g., switch-case → polymorphism).
- They struggle with implicit dependencies and domain-specific adaptations without sufficient contextual code.
- Model outputs benefit greatly from prompt conditioning and in-context examples.

5. Developer-in-the-Loop Paradigm:
- Authors emphasize human-in-the-loop design where LLM suggestions are validated and adjusted by developers.
- A prototype IDE plugin was tested, showing time savings of 40-60% for boilerplate-heavy migration tasks (e.g., Java EE to Spring Boot).

6. Key Use Cases:
- Assisting in migrating legacy UI layers to modern frameworks.
- Refactoring legacy authentication and session management code to OAuth-based solutions.
- Completing partially modernized code with consistent patterns.

7. Implications for Legacy Modernization:
- LLMs reduce the barrier to entry for initial modernization stages, especially in poorly documented systems.
- They can bootstrap migration pipelines by generating scaffolding code, adapters, or wrappers.
- However, they require tight integration with testing infrastructure and version control for production-grade use.

8. Recommendations:
- Fine-tune LLMs on organization-specific legacy codebases to improve accuracy.
- Combine LLM outputs with static analysis and test harness validation.
- Employ prompt libraries with architectural constraints to guide completions more accurately.

Conclusion:
Sato et al. (2024) highlight the growing role of LLMs in legacy modernization, particularly for code migration and adaptation tasks. Their work lays the groundwork for robust integration of LLMs into enterprise development pipelines, with measurable productivity gains and quality improvements when properly supervised.

Significant Points from:
Wu et al., “UICoder: Finetuning Large Language Models to Generate User Interface Code through Automated Feedback,” arXiv:2406.07739, 2024.

1. Domain-Specific Finetuning for UI Code:
   - The paper introduces **UICoder**, a domain-specific LLM fine-tuned for generating SwiftUI code from natural language.
   - It highlights the insufficiency of pretrained LLMs in UI generation due to their lack of UI-specific examples in pretraining corpora.

2. Self-Distillation with Automated Feedback Loop:
   - UICoder leverages a **self-distillation pipeline**, where:
     - An initial LLM generates synthetic training data.
     - A compiler checks for syntactic validity.
     - A vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) evaluates visual-textual alignment.
   - This closed-loop feedback automatically refines and filters the training dataset across iterations.

3. Automated Generation of Large UI Dataset:
   - Over **1 million UI code samples** were generated synthetically from text prompts.
   - Automated filtering (compilation and visual feedback) ensures only high-quality samples are retained for model tuning.

4. Multi-Iteration Training Strategy:
   - UICoder undergoes multiple iterations of generation → filtering → finetuning.
   - Each iteration uses the improved model to generate better synthetic data.
   - This progressive refinement ensures continuous model improvement without manual labeling.

5. Quantitative and Qualitative Evaluation:
   - UICoder outperforms baselines like StarCoder, CodeLLaMA, and StarChat-Beta on:
     - **Compilation success rate**
     - **CLIP similarity scores**
     - **Human preference metrics**
   - Human annotators preferred UICoder’s output significantly more often for visual fidelity and intent match.

6. Vision-Language Grounding for UI:
   - By integrating visual models (CLIP), the approach bridges the semantic gap between **natural language, UI layout, and source code**.
   - This provides a generalizable approach to UI generation that considers *what the UI should look like*, not just what it should do.

7. Practicality for Industry:
   - Demonstrates that modern LLMs can be specialized for GUI development through **cost-effective, automated training**.
   - Reduces the need for costly human-curated datasets.
   - Accelerates rapid prototyping and modernization of UI layers in legacy systems.

Title: LLM4UI: Towards User Interface Generation with Large Language Models  
Authors: Jin Park, Junhee Oh, Hyung Yoon, Jinseok Lee  
Source: arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.13050, May 2024  
URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13050  

Significant Points for Legacy Application Modernization Using LLMs — In Detail:

1. Feedback-Driven UI Generation:
   - The paper proposes an iterative process where LLM-generated code is rendered into UI, and rendering feedback (errors, visual mismatches) is used to guide the next generation cycle.
   - This closed-loop design is significant for modernization because it allows automatic correction of layout and syntax errors in legacy UI regeneration tasks.

2. Prompt Engineering and Instruction Tuning:
   - LLM4UI employs modular prompt templates that describe layout requirements and component specifications (e.g., “a login form with username and password inputs”).
   - These prompts mimic the user stories and interface specifications often found in legacy system documentation, thus providing a pathway to bootstrap UI components directly from existing specifications.

3. Prototype System — Flute X GPT:
   - A working system called Flute X GPT is built, which takes textual prompts, generates UI code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), and renders the result dynamically.
   - For legacy modernization, this suggests an end-to-end scaffolding mechanism where outdated interfaces (e.g., terminal-based or COBOL-based forms) can be refactored into web-based interfaces through LLM assistance.

4. Validation and Evaluation Metrics:
   - Generated UIs are evaluated based on correctness (no syntax errors), visual fidelity (alignment and sizing), and interactivity (functional components).
   - The system outperforms baseline LLM outputs (i.e., ChatGPT without feedback loops) with measurable improvements, which is crucial for enterprise-grade modernization where reliability and precision are key.

5. Human-in-the-Loop Integration:
   - The framework allows manual adjustments to be fed back into the prompt, enabling iterative refinement of UI code.
   - This aligns with best practices in modernization workflows that combine automation with expert review, particularly in regulated industries.

6. Multimodal Reasoning:
   - Although the LLM only processes text, it receives textual summaries of visual renderings (e.g., “The button is misaligned to the left”) to refine its outputs.
   - This introduces a novel way of combining UI render analysis with natural language-based generation, which could be extended for visual inspection of legacy systems (e.g., screenshot-based modernization).

7. Domain Adaptability:
   - The system currently targets general web components, but the methodology is extensible to domain-specific UIs (e.g., medical interfaces, fintech dashboards), supporting vertical modernization.
   - This flexibility makes LLM4UI adaptable to different organizational legacy systems with unique front-end requirements.

8. Limitations Acknowledged:
   - Current approach cannot model complex interactive behavior (e.g., multi-step forms with logic).
   - Feedback is text-based rather than pixel-level or semantic-tree level, potentially missing nuanced defects.
   - Rendering feedback incurs additional latency, which may limit real-time usability in production environments.

9. Implications for Modernization Frameworks:
   - LLM4UI’s approach can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for modern front-end regeneration.
   - Legacy forms, data entry screens, and command-line interfaces can be systematically translated into responsive web UIs using similar techniques.
   - Reinforces the utility of LLMs in both code synthesis and iterative debugging within UI-centric modernization workflows.

10. Strategic Importance:
   - Provides a foundational architecture for automated, feedback-driven UI modernization using LLMs.
   - Acts as a bridge between design intent (expressed in natural language) and production-ready UI code.
   - Can serve as a front-end counterpart in large-scale system refactoring projects that focus on decoupling monolithic UIs from backend logic.
