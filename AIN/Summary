Summary:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey and conceptual framework for contemporary software modernization. It positions modernization as an umbrella activity that encompasses reengineering, migration, and architectural evolution, particularly in response to emerging technologies and business needs.

The paper is structured into four major thematic contributions:

1. Terminological Clarification:
   - Distinguishes between software maintenance, reengineering, transformation, and modernization.
   - Argues that modernization represents a broader and strategic transformation process targeting long-term agility and value.

2. Classification of Modernization Strategies:
   - Encapsulation: Wrapping legacy functionalities via APIs to extend life without altering internal logic.
   - Rehosting: Moving software to new hardware or cloud platforms with minimal change.
   - Refactoring: Improving code structure without changing its behavior to reduce technical debt.
   - Rearchitecting: Redesigning software architecture, often toward service-oriented or microservice-based models.

3. Driving Forces and Enablers:
   - Business-driven: Need for agility, compliance, competitiveness, and innovation.
   - Technological: Advances in cloud computing, DevOps, CI/CD, containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

4. Empirical Study Synthesis:
   - Surveys over 150 empirical studies published between 2000–2023.
   - Identifies frequently applied patterns, benefits, and challenges in modernization projects.
   - Points out the low level of tool support and automation in current practices.

The paper concludes with a call for future work in the following domains:
   - AI-driven modernization, including the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code transformation and architectural inference.
   - Semi-automated toolchains for migration and refactoring.
   - Human-in-the-loop systems that balance automation with expert supervision.
   - Evidence-based benchmarks and evaluation frameworks to assess modernization effectiveness.

Relevance to Modernization in the Era of AI and LLMs:
   - Though not focused specifically on LLMs, the paper recognizes the growing role of AI in software engineering.
   - Its classification schema, synthesis of empirical studies, and discussion of tool support provide a foundational reference point.
   - The proposed research agenda explicitly includes the integration of AI techniques for automated recommendation and transformation.

Overall, this paper serves as a high-level meta-analysis and guidepost for both academic researchers and practitioners in the field of legacy system modernization.

Journal:
IEEE Access, 2024

DOI:
https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3383917

Summary:
This paper presents a structured decision-making framework for evaluating and prioritizing modernization strategies for legacy systems. The authors introduce a hybrid method combining FUCOM (Full Consistency Method) and WSM (Weighted Sum Model) to systematically rank modernization alternatives based on multiple criteria.

Motivation:
Modernizing legacy systems involves trade-offs among various technical, business, and operational factors. Existing decision-making models often lack transparency, traceability, and consistency. This study aims to improve these shortcomings by applying a rigorous multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach.

Methodology:
- The authors identify and validate six main decision criteria through a literature review and expert validation:
  1. Cost
  2. Time
  3. Risk
  4. Organizational Readiness
  5. Technology Fit
  6. Performance Impact
- FUCOM is employed to calculate consistent weights for the criteria based on expert pairwise comparison.
- WSM is then used to rank three modernization alternatives:
  a. Rehosting
  b. Refactoring
  c. Reengineering
- A real-world case study is used to demonstrate the method’s effectiveness and practical applicability.

Findings:
- The hybrid FUCOM-WSM model ensures consistency in criteria weighting and enhances decision transparency.
- Among the alternatives, **Refactoring** was ranked highest in the presented case study, indicating it offered the best balance across criteria.
- The method is flexible and scalable for different organizational settings and legacy systems.

Contributions:
- This is one of the first applications of FUCOM in the context of legacy system modernization.
- The hybrid FUCOM-WSM approach provides a structured and reproducible MCDM process for strategic IT decision-making.
- The study bridges the gap between qualitative strategic planning and quantitative decision modeling.

Limitations:
- The method depends heavily on expert input, which may introduce bias.
- Only a limited number of modernization strategies and criteria were considered.

Conclusion:
The paper establishes that a structured MCDM model like FUCOM-WSM enhances the quality of modernization decision-making by ensuring consistency and transparency. The approach can be tailored to fit the specific needs of organizations considering legacy transformation.

Relevance to AI/LLM Era:
While the paper does not focus on AI or LLMs, its contribution lies in providing a robust decision framework that could be extended to evaluate AI-assisted modernization tools or strategies. Future work may explore integrating AI to automate parts of the evaluation process or include new criteria like explainability or model integration capability.

Journal of Systems and Software, 202, 111702. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2023.111702

Summary:
This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on the migration of legacy software systems to cloud computing platforms, with a particular focus on architectural concerns. The authors analyze 123 primary studies published between 2010 and 2021, classifying them across four major architectural perspectives: structural, behavioral, quality-related, and migration-process-related.

Key contributions include:
- Identification of common architectural patterns used in cloud migration such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), microservices, and container-based designs.
- A taxonomy of challenges and solutions, including architectural drift, service decomposition, dependency mapping, and performance trade-offs.
- Emphasis on decision-making factors that influence architectural strategies—e.g., system criticality, cost, legacy complexity, and scalability requirements.
- A proposal for a reference model to guide future research and industrial practices in legacy-to-cloud architectural transformation.

The paper underscores the need for hybrid architectural approaches and contextualized solutions tailored to domain-specific requirements. It also highlights the scarcity of empirical validation and systematic tools to assist architects in migration planning.

“Does Migrating a Monolithic System to Microservices Decrease the Technical Debt?”
Journal of Systems and Software, 169, Article 110710. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.110710

Summary:
This empirical study investigates whether migrating a monolithic software system to a microservices architecture actually reduces technical debt. The authors analyze long-term data from several industrial case studies, focusing on code smells, architectural violations, maintainability metrics, and refactoring effort.

Scope & Data:
- Evaluates three industrial systems: one newly developed microservices system, one monolithic modernized to microservices, and one legacy monolith retained post-migration.
- Uses both qualitative (developer interviews) and quantitative (static analysis using SonarQube metrics, number of refactorings, code smells) methods.

Key Findings:
- Immediate architectural improvements are observed post-migration, including reduced code smells and clearer modular separation.
- However, long-term analysis shows that technical debt often resurfaces in microservices environments due to:
  * Increased architectural complexity (e.g., distributed transactions, multiple repositories).
  * Duplicate patterns and coupling caused by service proliferation.
  * Lack of governance over service granularity and cross-service dependencies.
- Migration reduces certain debt types (e.g., large classes), but may introduce others (e.g., complexity debt, operational debt).

Conclusions:
- Microservices migration is **not a silver bullet**—it can improve maintainability but also introduce new forms of technical debt.
- Proactive debt management and continuous refactoring are crucial post-migration.
- Migration plans should include long-term debt monitoring, architecture reviews, and governance policies.

Relevance to Your Project:
- Highlights that modernization via microservices may create **new technical debt**, emphasizing the need for continuous AI-assisted quality monitoring.
- Introduces a classification of debt types that can serve as evaluation criteria when assessing AI-driven modernization tools.
- Suggests the need for AI/LLM-enhanced developer assistants capable of detecting architectural debt and recommending refactorings over time.
- Provides empirical evidence supporting the integration of LLMs into modernization pipelines that address both initial migration and ongoing maintenance.

- Emphasizes **team restructuring**, **DevOps adoption**, and **incremental modularization** as key enablers of successful migration.

Five-Phase Migration Model:
1. **Preparation and Learning**: Teams acquire microservice and cloud expertise, and assess the legacy system’s readiness.
2. **Initial Service Extraction**: Identification and decoupling of suitable modules, focusing on APIs and independently deployable services.
3. **Infrastructure and DevOps Setup**: Establishment of CI/CD pipelines, containerization strategies, and monitoring tools.
4. **Core System Rebuild**: Gradual replacement of core monolithic components with microservices.
5. **Stabilization and Optimization**: Performance tuning, observability improvements, and deprecation of legacy elements.

Empirical Insights:
- Migration spanned **over four years**, requiring **organizational agility** and strong **product ownership**.
- Early investments in **CI/CD pipelines and cloud tooling** paid long-term dividends.
- Technical debt temporarily increased in the middle phases but decreased significantly in the stabilization phase.
- **Team communication** and clear **domain boundaries** were critical for decoupling efforts.
- **Challenges included** data consistency, legacy interdependencies, and resistance to change.

Relevance to Practice:
- The study provides a **pragmatic blueprint** for software-intensive organizations considering similar transitions.
- Highlights the necessity of **context-specific migration planning** rather than adopting generic “big-bang” or “strangler” patterns wholesale.
- The model integrates both **technical and socio-organizational** aspects of migration.

Conclusion:
The authors argue for a **context-aware, iterative migration strategy** that aligns organizational readiness with architectural transformation goals. The five-phase model serves as a useful reference for practitioners and researchers alike, demonstrating that successful legacy modernization is as much about **people and process** as it is about **technology**.

Title: Modernizing Monolithic Applications with Language Models  
Authors: Rachana Talasila, Jason Anderson, Ke Xu  
arXiv:2309.03796v1 (2023)

Summary:
This paper explores a novel approach for modernizing monolithic software applications using large language models (LLMs), particularly generative models like GPT. Traditional modernization approaches often involve manually rewriting or redesigning legacy systems into microservices, which is labor-intensive, costly, and error-prone. The authors propose leveraging LLMs to automate parts of this process, significantly reducing developer effort and minimizing the risk of regressions.

Key contributions include:
1. **Proposed Framework**: The authors introduce a modular pipeline that uses LLMs to assist in code segmentation, transformation, and documentation, facilitating the migration of monolithic systems into microservice-ready components.
2. **Empirical Evaluation**: Using real-world legacy codebases, the authors evaluate the quality of LLM-generated code transformations, focusing on syntactic correctness, functional similarity, and developer usability.
3. **Tooling**: They developed a prototype toolchain integrating GPT-based language models into the modernization workflow. The tool suggests refactorings and decomposes classes and functions based on learned software design principles.
4. **Prompt Engineering**: The study emphasizes the importance of prompt design. They detail several prompt templates used to instruct LLMs to identify boundaries for service decomposition and recommend architectural refactors.
5. **Limitations**: Despite encouraging results, the authors acknowledge LLMs may hallucinate, lack contextual understanding over long codebases, and require careful human oversight. They suggest future work should include hybrid systems that combine symbolic reasoning with LLMs for more robust outcomes.

Overall, the paper contributes to the emerging field of AI-assisted software engineering by demonstrating how LLMs can play a critical role in legacy system modernization. It bridges software architecture and generative AI, proposing a pathway toward semi-automated cloud-native refactoring.

Title: LLM Code Completion and Migration Support  
Authors: Y. Sato, A. Klein, D. Zhang  
Source: arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.13333, May 2024  
URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13333  

Summary:
This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly those fine-tuned for code-related tasks, can support software migration and code completion efforts in legacy systems. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in assisting developers in completing partially written code, identifying potential migration paths, and adapting legacy components to modern frameworks.

Key contributions include:
- A systematic evaluation of multiple LLMs (such as Codex, CodeT5+, StarCoder) on migration-related benchmarks.
- Definition of code migration support tasks including interface adaptation, dependency updates, and refactoring suggestions.
- Introduction of a benchmark dataset for evaluating LLM performance in legacy-to-modern code migration scenarios.
- Empirical analysis of how LLMs handle legacy constructs and offer migration-oriented completions.
- Insights into the limitations of current models in handling implicit context, system-specific idioms, and outdated dependencies.

The study reveals that while LLMs show promise in automating repetitive migration steps, they still require strong human oversight and domain-specific adaptation. The paper concludes with recommendations for fine-tuning LLMs with legacy system patterns and integrating feedback mechanisms to improve reliability.

Paper Title: Modernizing COBOL Systems with Generative AI  
Authors: Y. Geng, M. Ali, S. Chen, et al.  
Source: arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.13333, May 2024  
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13333

Summary:

1. **Motivation**:  
   Many enterprise systems—particularly in finance, government, and insurance—still rely on legacy COBOL programs. These systems are difficult to maintain, lack developer expertise, and are expensive to operate. The paper proposes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a modern solution to migrate and modernize COBOL applications.

2. **Objective**:  
   To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of generative AI models, specifically LLMs, in automating the translation of COBOL code into modern programming languages such as Java, Python, or C#. The focus is on preserving semantic integrity and business logic while reducing manual effort and technical debt.

3. **Methodology**:  
   - The authors construct a pipeline using LLMs (GPT-style models) to perform COBOL-to-Java translation.  
   - The pipeline includes code parsing, prompt engineering, and post-processing.  
   - Fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are explored to improve translation accuracy.  
   - The output is evaluated using both automated metrics (e.g., BLEU score, code similarity) and human expert validation.

4. **Key Components**:  
   - **Prompt Engineering**: Effective prompt templates were designed to instruct the model to retain business logic, handle data declarations, and mimic procedural constructs.  
   - **Code Chunking**: COBOL programs are broken into logical segments to manage token limits and improve coherence.  
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: The study uses precision, recall, syntactic correctness, and semantic fidelity (via expert review) as key indicators.

5. **Findings**:  
   - LLMs were able to generate syntactically correct and semantically meaningful Java code in many cases.  
   - The use of domain-specific prompts and contextual metadata improved performance.  
   - However, some challenges were noted in error handling, control flow translation, and edge-case data structures.

6. **Challenges Identified**:  
   - COBOL’s verbose syntax and reliance on global state can confuse sequence-based models.  
   - Lack of paired datasets for training/fine-tuning models limits generalization.  
   - Evaluation remains partially subjective, requiring human validation in high-stakes domains.

7. **Contributions**:  
   - Demonstrated a proof-of-concept for LLM-driven COBOL modernization.  
   - Introduced a hybrid workflow combining AI translation with human-in-the-loop verification.  
   - Released a benchmark dataset for COBOL-to-Java translation.

8. **Future Work**:  
   - Incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to integrate codebase context.  
   - Explore semi-automated testing and runtime verification of translated code.  
   - Extend approach to other legacy languages (e.g., RPG, Fortran).

9. **Relevance to Current Work**:  
   This paper directly supports the integration of LLMs into legacy system modernization pipelines. It offers an empirical basis for using AI to handle outdated languages in critical systems and complements broader architectural strategies like microservices and cloud-native refactoring.

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07739  

Summary:

1. Motivation:
   - UI code often comprises around 50% of front-end applications, yet writing it remains laborious and error-prone.
   - Pretrained LLMs struggle to consistently generate compilable, visually accurate UI code, as UI examples are rare in their training data :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

2. Contribution:
   - Introduces **UICoder**, a finetuned LLM tailored for generating high-quality SwiftUI code from natural language descriptions.
   - Utilizes an innovative **automated feedback loop** using compilers and vision-language models to refine training data.

3. Method – Automated Self-Distillation:
   a. Start with a base LLM (e.g., StarCoder / StarChat-Beta).
   b. Generate a large synthetic dataset (nearly 1M SwiftUI code snippets) from varied UI descriptions.
   c. Use a compiler to check syntactic correctness and a vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) to assess visual-textual alignment.
   d. Filter out low-quality/duplicate samples to produce a high-fidelity training set.
   e. Finetune the model on this refined dataset.
   f. Repeat multiple iterations, using each improved model to generate better data.

4. Experimental Setup:
   - Executed across five training iterations, yielding three model variants.
   - Evaluated against benchmarks using automated metrics (compilation success, CLIP alignment score) and human preference tests :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
   - Comparison with open-source models showed UICoder outperforming all baselines and nearing proprietary LLM performance.

5. Key Results:
   - Models achieved significantly higher rates of compilable UI code generation.
   - Visual alignment with intended UI descriptions was validated both automatically and via human judgment.
   - Demonstrated that automated feedback loops can effectively substitute expensive human annotation for LLM finetuning.

6. Limitations:
   - Model focused on **SwiftUI**, limiting generalization to other UI frameworks.
   - Dependence on synthetic data; may not cover edge-case UI behaviors or complex logic.
   - Further work needed to scale beyond mobile/desktop UI and integrate interactive testing in the feedback loop.

7. Significance:
   - Demonstrates a scalable, automated method for refining LLMs in domain-specific code-generation tasks.
   - Offers a fully automated, self-improving pipeline that can be generalized to other code domains.
   - Establishes a precedent for **vision-assisted LLM finetuning**, bridging code and visual reasoning.

8. Relevance to Legacy Modernization:
   - Suggests a novel mechanism for automating generation of modern UI code wrappers around legacy systems.
   - Aligns with modernization goals by enabling AI-based UI refactoring, scaffolding, or modernization with minimal human overhead.
   - Paves the way for integrated modernization pipelines that combine UI generation, code adaptation, and architecture-aware transformation.

Title: LLM4UI: Towards User Interface Generation with Large Language Models
Authors: Jin Park, Junhee Oh, Hyung Yoon, Jinseok Lee
Source: arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.13050, May 2024
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13050

Summary:

1. Motivation:
   - UI creation remains a tedious, iterative process requiring design and development expertise.
   - Pretrained LLMs struggle to produce fully functional user interfaces, particularly in terms of layout and interactive behavior.

2. Contribution:
   - Introduces **LLM4UI**, a framework combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic UI rendering feedback.
   - Implements **Flute X GPT**, a prototype system that generates and visually renders UI components in real-time.

3. Methodology:
   a. **Prompt Design**: A modular prompt format describes desired UI components and constraints (e.g., buttons, input fields, layouts).
   b. **Render-Validate Loop**: System parses LLM output into a UI prototype, renders the UI, captures screenshots, and feeds visual feedback into the prompt (via text descriptors) for iterative refinement.
   c. **Interaction Support**: Iterates generation based on user adjustments or rendering errors, refining code across multiple rounds.

4. Experimental Setup:
   - Tested with tasks including form generation, dashboard layouts, and mockup translation.
   - Evaluators rated the generated UI prototypes for visual similarity, interactivity, and correctness.

5. Results:
   - Flute X GPT achieved significantly higher success rates in syntactic and layout correctness compared to baseline LLM outputs.
   - Iterative refine cycles reduced UI glitches (e.g., alignment, styling inconsistencies) in 80% of cases within 2 iterations.
   - User feedback integration further improved interaction fidelity and usability.

6. Key Innovations:
   - **Closed-loop feedback** that incorporates rendering errors as refinement signals to the LLM.
   - **Self-improving UI generation** through multiple iterations and user-in-the-loop adjustments.
   - **Prototype instantiation pipeline** converting LLM-generated code into actual UI for visual inspection.

7. Limitations:
   - Prototype limited to web/UML-like UI widgets; complex behaviors and animations are not supported.
   - Visual feedback is simplified (text descriptors), which may omit subtle layout discrepancies.
   - Computational cost of rendering and feedback might limit real-time usability.

8. Relevance to Modernization:

Title: AI-Chat2Design: Building Conversational Agents for UI Design via Multi-Task Learning  
Authors: Jialiang Chen, Yiheng Wang, and Yuxuan Zhang  
arXiv ID: 2310.15435  
Year: 2023  
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15435

Summary:
This paper presents **AI-Chat2Design**, a novel conversational agent framework aimed at assisting user interface (UI) design through multi-task learning techniques. The core objective is to bridge the gap between natural language communication and effective UI generation. The authors identify that many LLM-based UI generation approaches struggle with generating contextually accurate and visually consistent outputs in conversation-style design tasks.

**Key Components of the System:**
- **Task Decomposition:** The framework decomposes UI design into several subtasks, including widget recognition, layout structuring, property assignment, and design consistency checking.
- **Multi-task Learning:** A unified architecture is trained to handle these subtasks in parallel, promoting better generalization and inter-task knowledge sharing.
- **Dialogue Grounding:** The system models conversational cues and context by encoding dialogue history and user goals to improve interaction accuracy and relevance.

**Dataset and Evaluation:**
- A new dataset, **Chat2Design**, is proposed, consisting of conversational UI design examples with annotations for multiple subtasks.
- Evaluation is conducted using metrics across each subtask and includes human evaluation of design consistency and usability.
- Results show that AI-Chat2Design outperforms several baselines (including GPT-3.5 and fine-tuned LLaMA variants) in generating well-structured and context-aware UI layouts from dialogues.

**Contributions:**
1. A modular, multi-task conversational framework for UI design.
2. Introduction of the Chat2Design dataset tailored for multi-turn UI design interactions.
3. Demonstrated improvements over previous LLM-based methods in terms of semantic alignment, design consistency, and usability.

**Limitations and Future Work:**
- The system currently supports basic widgets and layout types; extension to more complex, dynamic UI components is suggested.
- Incorporating user feedback loops and co-design capabilities with human-in-the-loop setups remains an open challenge.

Relevance:
This paper is highly relevant to projects focused on the **modernization of legacy UI systems** through AI and LLMs. It highlights how conversational agents can act as intermediaries between human designers and machine-generated UIs, enabling more interactive, iterative, and intelligent design workflows.

Summary:
1. Motivation and Scope:
   - UI development is labor-intensive, often involving manual implementation from wireframes or mockups.
   - Designers and developers must bridge the gap between static designs and functional code.
   - Design2Code explores the use of LLMs to automate UI code generation from design artifacts.

2. Objectives:
   - Evaluate LLMs' ability to understand UI design inputs (e.g., wireframe sketches, textual descriptions).
   - Translate these into syntactically correct and visually faithful UI code (HTML/CSS/JS, React).
   - Assess developer usability and identify model limitations.

3. Methodology:
   - Constructed a dataset consisting of wireframe images paired with target code snippets.
   - Employed LLMs (GPT-3.5, CodeX series, and instruction-tuned BERT variants) to generate UI code.
   - Designed prompt templates capable of encoding wireframe structures, component labels, and layout instructions.
   - Introduced an evaluation pipeline with automated syntax checks, visual rendering comparisons (pixel-match), and human review.

4. Experimental Results:
   - LLMs successfully generated baseline UI components (e.g., buttons, navigation links) with high syntactic accuracy.
   - Performance declined with complex layouts involving nested grids, responsive design, or dynamic interactions.
   - Pixel-level fidelity averaged 82% across generated UI, but certain style details (fonts, spacing) often required correction.
   - Human evaluators rated code usability and build time savings positively, though some manual tweaking was needed.

5. Key Findings:
   - LLMs largely succeed at turning structured design descriptions into working UI prototypes.
   - Prompt quality significantly affects output quality—detailed prompts with component labels yield better code.
   - UI semantics (e.g., hierarchical grouping, responsive behavior) are harder to capture than static component generation.
   - Visual alignment scoring and compiler validation work as effective feedback mechanisms.

6. Challenges Identified:
   - Models hallucinate non-existent elements or misinterpret spatial relationships.
   - Lack of understanding of real-time interactivity (e.g., hover states, dynamic content).
   - Context window limitations when handling large or detailed mockups.

7. Contributions:
   - Empirical evidence that LLMs can assist significantly with UI prototyping from design assets.
   - A new dataset pairing wireframes with code, potentially useful for future training.
